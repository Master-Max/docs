***********************************************
Adapt Your Add-ons and Themes to CS-Cart 4.10.1
***********************************************

==============
Common Changes
==============

#. Deprecated payment method **FuturePay** was deleted.

#. The functionality of the ``rus_pickup`` add-on (previously exclusive to Russian version) was transferred to the ``store_locator`` add-on, which was renamed to **Stores and pickup points**.

#. The ``rus_customer_geolocation`` add-on was removed. Its functionality was split between the new checkout and the ``geo_maps`` (**Maps and geolocation**) add-on.

#. The functionality of searching for *New orders* was removed along with the ``new_orders`` table.

#. New microformat ``cm-mask-phone`` that allows you to add a phone number mask to a field was added. The mask is automatically determined from the first characters of the number entered.

#. New setting type ``L`` was added. It is an input field that has microformat ``cm-mask-phone``.

#. A new shipping service interface called ``IPickupService`` was added. The interface declares methods that are specific to shipping methods with pickup points. The method called ``getPickupPoints`` is reserved for future use, since there is no unified data structure to represent the list of pickup points yet.

#. A new ``Tygh::$app['location']`` service for working with the current customer location (country, state, city, address and ZIP code) was added.

#. A new ``Tygh::$app['storefront']`` service for fetching the data of the current storefront was added. 

   To manage storefronts (create, update, find, or remove them), use Storefronts Repository. It can be accessed via the ``Tygh::$app['storefront.repository']`` service.

#. The ``\Tygh\Http`` class now allows you to specify the execution time for a request. To do that, set a value for the ``execution_timeout`` key in the ``extra`` array::

     \Tygh\Http::get('http://example.com', [], ['execution_timeout' => 5]); // Setting the timeout to 5 seconds

   If no value is passed, the default value of 90 seconds will be used (180 seconds in the console mode).

   The ``timeout`` key of the ``extra`` array was renamed to ``connection_timeout``, because it sets the timeout for the confirmation of connection; backward compatibility was preserved.

------------------------
Add-on Schema: Version 4
------------------------

New schema for describing add-ons was added. Schema v4 aims to allow writing add-ons in object-oriented style. This version of the schema is still being developed, but you can already use the following improvements:

* **autoload**. This section serves for declarative description of directories that will be registered in the auto-loader of classes. Learn more about PSR-4 at `the website of PHP Framework Interoperability Group <https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/>`_.

  Example of use:

  .. code-block:: xml

    <autoload>
        <psr4 prefix="Tygh\Addons\ProductVariations\">src</psr4>
        <psr4 prefix="Tygh\Addons\ProductVariations\Tests\Unit\">tests</psr4>
    </autoload>

* **bootstrap**. This section is meant for specifying the loader class of the add-on. It's the equivalent of init.php in schema v3.

  The class must implement the ``\Tygh\Core\BootstrapInterface`` interface with the ``boot`` method, that will be called during every initialization of the add-on. Usually, the ``boot`` method should include only the code that handles the registration of services. Additionally, the bootstrap class may implement ``\Tygh\Core\HookHandlerProviderInterface``, that is used for describing hook handlers. ``\Tygh\Core\HookHandlerProviderInterface`` requires implementation of the ``getHookHandlerMap`` method, that must return an array with the description of hook handlers.

  Formats for describing hook handlers:

  * **Simplified format:** *hook => callable*. Key is hook name, and value is either any callable construction, or a method from a service in the container of dependencies. Examples:

    *

      ::

        'get_products' => ['Tygh\Addons\MyChanges\ProductsHookHandler', 'onGetProducts']

      It expects the presence of static method ``Tygh\Addons\MyChanges\ProductsHookHandler::onGetProducts``.

    *

      ::

        'get_products' => function ($params, $products) { //... }

      Anonymous function is used.

    *

      ::

        'get_products' => ['addons.my_changes.products_hook_handler', 'onGetProducts']

      It expects the ``addons.my_changes.products_hook_handler`` service registered in ``Tygh::$app``, along with the ``'onGetProducts'`` method.

    The simplified format also allows specifying priority of the hook handler as the third element of the array. For example::

      'get_route' => [
          'addons.product_variations.hook_handlers.seo',
          'onGetRoute',
          1900
      ],

  * **Extended format:** *hook_key => hook_handler_definition*. For example::

      'discussions_variation_group_mark_product_as_main_post' => [
          'hook'     => 'variation_group_mark_product_as_main_post',
          'handler'  => [
              'addons.product_variations.hook_handlers.discussions',
              'onVariationGroupMarkProductAsMainPost',
          ],
          'addon'    => 'discussion',
          'priority' => 790
      ],

    Any meaningful code can serve as the array key.
    
    * ``hook``—hook name.

    * ``handler``—the description of the hook handler. The value can be any callable construction, or a method from a service in the container of dependencies.

    * ``addon``—the code of the add-on on behalf of which the handler is registered. This parameter can be skipped; in that case, the hook handler will be registered on behalf of the current add-on.

    * ``priority``—priority of the handler. This parameter can be skipped; int hat case, the priority from the add-on will be used. 

* **installer**. This section is meant for specifying the class that will be used when the add-on is installed or uninstalled. The class must implement the ``\Tygh\Addons\InstallerInterface`` interface with the following methods:

  * ``factory(ApplicationInterface $app)`` — a static method that returns the instance of a class. The method will be called when the class is necessary.

  * ``onBeforeInstall()``—the equivalent of ``before_install`` from schema 3.0; will be called before add-on installation.

  * ``onInstall()``—the equivalent of ``install`` from schema 3.0; will be called during add-on installation.

  * ``onUninstall()``—the equivalent of ``uninstall`` from schema 3.0; will be called before the add-on is uninstalled.

------------
New Checkout
------------

* New single-page checkout was integrated into the core.

* The **Lite checkout** add-on that provided this functionality earlier in the Russian version was removed.

* The old checkout functionality was moved to a separate add-on called **Step-by-Step Checkout**.

* The layout of the new checkout is now based on separate blocks. The blocks will be created automatically when the **Step-by-Step Checkout** add-on is disabled or uninstalled. On new installations, the necessary blocks will exist by default. Their names start with ``Checkout: ...``.

* The **Main content** block must be disabled when the new checkout is used.

* The new **Lite checkout** wrapper must be applied to the grid that contains all the blocks. Without that wrapper, the new checkout will not function properly.

-------------
Block Manager
-------------

The ability to specify a grid wrapper was added. If a wrapper is selected for a grid, then the corresponding template will be included, and the content of all blocks will be passed inside.

-------------------
Call Request Add-on
-------------------

The functionality associated with the masks of phone numbers was transferred to the core. Add-on settings that affect phone number masks are now deprecated; we don't recommended using them.

-----------------------------
HiDPI Displays Support Add-on
-----------------------------

The add-on was significantly reworked: it will not shrink the images during the uploading process. The JS code for loading 2x images was removed, and now the ``srcset`` attribute is used for this task.

-----------------------------------------
Pickup Point Data in E-Mail Notifications
-----------------------------------------

Information about the pickup point chosen for the order is now available in the templates of e-mail notifications and documents in the ``pickup_point`` variable and in the ``pickup_point`` snippet.

To specify the pickup point data with your add-on, use the ``pickup_point_variable_init`` hook.

----------------------
jQuery Version Upgrade
----------------------

CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor now use jQuery v3.3.1 instead of the legacy v1.9.1. The primary goal of this is to patch CS-Cart against the CVE-2015-9251 vulnerability that affects old versions of jQuery.

We will include the **jQuery Migrate** plugin to keep the backward compatibility with existing add-ons and themes. However, if your add-ons or themes depend on legacy features of jQuery, it's time to upgrade them now.

------------------------------------
Spectrum Colorpicker Library Upgrade
------------------------------------

CS-Cart now uses Spectrum Colorpicker v1.8.0 instead of the legacy v1.0.9.

.. _en-function-description:

--------------------
Shipping Calculation
--------------------

Before CS-Cart / Multi-Vendor 4.10.1, the ``$calculate_shipping`` parameter of the ``fn_calculate_cart_content`` function wasn't working as described: the shipping calculation process within the function didn't depend on its value.

Starting with version 4.10.1 this parameter will affect the function behavior as described.

.. note::

    **Backward compatibility note:** the ``fn_calculate_cart_content`` function will check the ``$cart['calculate_shipping']`` field. If its value is set to ``true``, then shipping calculation will be forced.

------------------------------------
Multiple Storefronts in Multi-Vendor
------------------------------------

The ability to have multiple storefronts was added to Multi-Vendor. Each storefront can have a subset of countries, languages, currencies and vendors associated with it.

Only products of the selected vendors will appear on a storefront, and only selected languages and currencies will be available to customers.

Redirection based on customer's region is now possible in Multi-Vendor; it works the same way as in CS-Cart.

General settings ``store_mode`` and ``store_access_key`` were moved to storefronts.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Storefront-Related Changes in CS-Cart
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following fields of the ``companies`` table will be moved to storefronts: 

* *countries_list*

* *storefront*

* *redirect_customer*

To keep the backward compatibility, we will keep these fields in the ``companies`` table and will keep them updated, but their direct use is highly discouraged.

--------------------------------------
Separate Secure Storefront URL Removed
--------------------------------------

The **Secure storefront URL** field was removed from the store configuration page and won't be used in checks. All storefronts will function as if they use the same URL for non-secure and secure connection.

To keep the backward compatibility, we will keep this field in the ``companies`` table, but its direct use is highly discouraged.

------------------------------------
Introducing the Notifications Center
------------------------------------

A new way to display notifications for administrators was added: the Notifications Center.
It can be used as a replacement for the notifications shown with the ``fn_set_notification`` function.

To add notifications into the Notification Center, use the ``Tygh::$app['notifications_center']`` service. This service provides the ``\Tygh\NotificationsCenter\NotificationsCenter`` class instance configured for the current user.

To manually manage notifications (create, update, find, or remove them), use the ``Tygh::$app['notifications_center.repository']`` service. This service provides the configured ``\Tygh\NotificationsCenter\Repository`` class instance.

All the tabs that are displayed in the Notifications Center are described in the *notifications/notifications_center.php* schema; feel free to extend them for your needs.

-------------------------
Image Zoom Add-on Changes
-------------------------

The **Image Zoom** add-on no longer uses the **CloudZoom** JavaScript library due to its incompatibility with jQuery 3.3.1. **EasyZoom** is used instead.

Also, the proper support of RTL languages was implemented for the add-on.
