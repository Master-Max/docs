Hello World Add-on Tutorial
***************************

Introduction
============

Each add-on has its own directory inside the *app/addons* directory. The add-on is described in the file *addon.xml*.

Among the information listed there, are the add-on id, priority, version, display name, etc.

Basically, an add-on will run with only this file existing. All it will do will be just sit in the add-on list and do absolutely nothing. However, such add-on will be installable and uninstallable, even configurable and properly translated if you define settings and translations in the *addon.xml* file.

So, keeping that in mind, you can go on further and create your first CS-Cart add-on.


Hello, World!
=============

Go to the *app/addons* directory in the CS-Cart installation directory. There, create a directory called *hello_world* and switch to it. That will be your working directory for this add-on.

.. important::

    It is important that the add-on directory name is the same as the add-on id. Otherwise, the add-on will not install properly. 

As said before, all an add-on needs to have to be operational is the *addon.xml* file. Let's create this file.

Provide some basic add-on attributes:

    *   ``id``—(must be equal to the add-on catalog name, ``hello_world`` in our case)
    *   ``version``—set to ``1.0``
    *   ``name``—add-on display name in the default language (English, if not explicitly specified). Set to **Hello, World!**
    *   ``description``—add-on description in the default language (English, if not explicitly specified). Set to **Say hello to the world**
    *   ``priority``—set this one to something big like **100500**

The *addon.xml* file should look like this:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <?xml version="1.0"?>

        <addon scheme='3.0'>
            <id>hello_world</id>
            <version>1.0</version>
            <name>Hello World</name>
            <description>Say hello to the world</description>
            <priority>100500</priority>
        </addon>

This is enough for our add-on to start. Log in to your admin panel and switch to **Administration → Add-ons**. The add-on should be present in the list. You can install/uninstall and activate/disable it:

.. note::

    You may have to clear the store cache to view the changes in the add-on list. Add ``&cc`` at the end of the URL in the browser address field.

Pay attention to the ``scheme='3.0'`` parameter. Add-ons without this parameter are considered using the deprecated markup. It still may be present in some add-ons, but it should be done solely for backward compatibility.

OK, now let's add some settings.

To do that, create the ``settings`` section in the *addon.xml* file. Settings are divided to *sections* that contain *items*. Each item is a particular setting with its own name, type, default value, etc.

Put the following lines in your *addon.xml* after ``<priority>100500</priority>``:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <settings>
            <sections>
                <section id="general">
                    <items>
                        <item id="some_prop">
                            <name>Enter any text</name>
                            <type>input</type>
                            <default_value>Hello World!</default_value>
                        </item>
                        <item id="some_dropdown">
                            <name>Pick a value from the list</name>
                            <type>selectbox</type>
                            <default_value>blue</default_value>
                                <variants>
                                    <item id="red">
                                        <name>Red</name>
                                    </item>
                                    <item id="green">
                                        <name>Green</name>
                                    </item>
                                    <item id="blue">
                                        <name>Blue</name>
                                    </item>
                                </variants>
                        </item>
                    </items>
                </section>
            </sections>
        </settings>

Go back to the add-on management page in the CS-Cart admin panel and re-install the **Hello World** add-on.

Now, click the gear button and you'll see the **Settings** link. Click it and the add-on configuration dialog will appear, containing the settings you have just added:

That was not rocket science, was it? Still, that was not too helpful either. In the :doc:`next tutorial <advanced>`, we are going to create something more complicated and useful.
