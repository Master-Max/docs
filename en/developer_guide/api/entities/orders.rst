Orders are what an online store is about. Customers submit orders at checkout after adding at least one product to cart. Administrators can work with the submitted orders and add new orders themselves.

To get a list of orders, send a GET request to ``/api/orders/``::

  GET /api/orders/

This request returns 10 orders with a short list of details for each order.

Create an Order
===============

.. list-table::
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: 5 15

    *   -   CS-Cart
        -   Send a POST request to ``/api/stores/<company_id>/orders/``
    *   -   Multi-Vendor
        -   Send a POST request to ``/api/orders/``

.. important::

    A newly-created order will always have ``"status": "O"``. You can change it only when you update an order.

Pass the following fields with order details in the HTTP request body in accordance with the ``Content-Type``. Required fields are marked with *****:

* **user_id***—the unique identifier of the user. Can be omitted or set to 0 only if the request includes ``user_data``.

* **payment_id***—ID of the payment method. The payment method must be available in the store.

* **shipping_id***—ID of the shipping method. The shipping method must be available in the store and configured to calculate the cost of shipping to the address you pass in the request.

  Beginning with version 4.3.7, you can specify an array of shipping method IDs as the value of ``shipping_id``. The keys of the array would be the keys of the product groups in the cart.

  This comes useful when you create an order with the products from multiple vendors (in Multi-Vendor), or from multiple suppliers, or whenever else the products in the cart are separated into groups.

* **products***—an object (associative array) with the information about the ordered products. There are two ways how you can specify a product:


  * Way 1: Product IDs serve as the keys, and the values are product details::

      "products": {
          "241": {
              "amount": "1",
              "product_options": {
                 "12": "44", 
                 "13": "48" 
              }         
          }
      }

    .. important::

        If you want your order to have multiple instances of the same product, but with different selected :doc:`options <options>` and :doc:`option combination <combinations>`, don't use product IDs as keys; use Way 2 instead.

  * Way 2: Keys are random numbers, and product IDs are included in the values among other product details::

      "products": {
        "1": {
            "product_id": "12",
            "amount": "1",
            "product_options": {
                "3": "12",
                "4": "17"
            }
        },
        "2": {
            "product_id": "12",
            "amount": "2",
            "product_options": {
                "3": "15",
                "4": "19"
            }
        }
      }

  .. note::

       Product price is taken from the :doc:`product settings <products>`, not from the JSON data. A ``discount`` on product can't be specified in the POST request, but only in the PUT request.

  * **amount***—the amount of this particular product that is being ordered.

  * **product_options**—an object (associative array) that describes the options and option variants of the product. Option ID serves as the key, and option variant serves as the value.

* **user_data**—an object (associative array) with the customer’s data. If you specify a ``user_id`` other than 0, this parameter won’t be considered and can be omitted. If ``user_id`` is omitted or set to 0, ``user_data`` is required::

    "user_data": {
      "email": "email@example.com",
      "b_firstname": "John",
      "b_lastname": "Doe",
      "b_address": "44 Main street",

      "s_country": "US",
      "s_zipcode": "02134",
      "s_phone": ""
    }

  * **email***—customer’s e-mail
  * **b_firstname***—first name (billing address)
  * **b_lastname***—last name (billing address)
  * **b_address***—address (billing address)
  * **b_city***—city (billing address)
  * **b_state***—2-symbol state code (billing address)
  * **b_country***—2-letter country code (billing address) 
  * **b_zipcode***—zip code (billing address)
  * **b_phone***—phone number (billing address)
  * **s_firstname***—first name (shipping address)
  * **s_lastname***—last name (shipping address)
  * **s_address***—address (shipping address)
  * **s_city***—city (shipping address)
  * **s_state***—2-symbol state code (shipping address)
  * **s_country***—2-symbol country code (shipping address)
  * **s_zipcode***—zip code (shipping address)

        -   Send a POST request to ``/api/stores/<company_id>/orders/``
    *   -   Multi-Vendor
        -   Send a POST request to ``/api/orders/``

**Required fields:** ``user_data``, ``payment_id``, ``shipping_id``, ``products``

**Example JSON:**

::

  {
   "user_id": "0",
   "payment_id": "2",
   "shipping_id": "1",
   "products": {
       "1": {
         "product_id": "12",
         "amount": "1"
       },
       "2": {
         "product_id":"13",
         "amount":"2"
       }
   }, 
   "user_data": {
      "email":"guest@example.com",
      "firstname": "Guest",
      "lastname": "Guest", 
      "s_firstname": "Guest",
      "s_lastname": "Guest",
      "s_country": "US",
      "s_city": "Boston",
      "s_state": "MA",
      "s_zipcode": "02125",
      "s_address": "44 Main street",
      "b_firstname": "Guest",
      "b_lastname": "Guest",
      "b_country":"US",
      "b_city": "Boston",
      "b_state": "MA",
      "b_zipcode":"02125",
      "b_address": "44 Main street"
   }
  }

This request is similar to the previous example, but the order is placed on behalf of a guest with the specified contact details.

.. note::

    Guests specify their address and contact information at checkout. That’s why you must pass the ``user_data`` object in the JSON when you place an order on behalf a guest.

---------------
Response Format
---------------

* The order has been created successfully: **HTTP/1.1 201 Created** and the order ID::

    {
     "order_id": "98"
    }

* The order couldn’t be created: **HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request**.

===============
Update an Order
===============

To update an existing order, send the PUT request to ``/api/orders/<order_id>/``. For example::

  PUT /api/orders/98

Pass the fields with order details in the HTTP request body in accordance with the passed ``Content-Type``. None of the fields are required.

---------------------------------------------
Example JSON: Change Status & Notify by Email 
---------------------------------------------

By default, when you change the order status via REST API, no email notifications are sent. However, you can use additional fields when updating an order, with *0* or *1* as values:

* **notify_user**—this flag determines whether or not to send the notification to the customer.

* **notify_department**—this flag determines whether or not to send the notification to the order department.

* **notify_vendor**—this flag determines whether or not to send the notification to the vendor.

  .. note::

      The **notify_vendor** flag is available only in Multi-Vendor.

::

  {
   "status": "P",
   "notify_user": "1",
   "notify_department": "1",
   "notify_vendor": "1"
  }

This request sets the status of the order to ``P`` (*Processed* by default) and sends email notifications to the customer, the vendor, and the order department.

-----------------------------
Example JSON: Change Products
-----------------------------

::

  {
   "products": {
     "1": {
       "product_id": "12",
       "amount": "1"
     },
     "3": {
       "product_id": "241",
       "amount": "1",
        "product_options": {
           "12": "44", 
           "13": "48" 
        }         
     }
   }
  }

This request changes the products assigned to the order. When we created order 98, it had one product with ``product_id=12`` and two products with ``product_id=13``. After this request the order will have one product with ``product_id=12``, and one product with ``product_id=241``.

As you can see, product 241 also has the option variants selected:

* variant 44 of option 12.

* variant 48 of option 13.

.. note::

    If an order has multiple products, make sure to specify them all when you update the ``products`` object with the PUT request. Products that are not specified in the PUT request will be removed from the order. The same applies to product option variants.

-------------------------------------------------
Example JSON: Change User Details and Order Total
-------------------------------------------------

::

  {
   "total": "100"
   "user_data": {
     "email": "customer@example.com",
     "b_firstname": "John",
     "b_lastname": "Doe",
     "s_firstname": "John",
     "s_lastname": "Doe"
   }
  }

This request:

* changes the name of the customer in the billing and shipping address to *John Doe*;

* changes the customer's email to *customer@example.com*;

.. note::

    This won't change the name or email of the :doc:`user <users>`—only the name and email on the order page will change.

* sets the order total to $100 (if U.S. dollar is the primary currency of your store).

.. note::

    If you try to specify the ``total`` and other parameters that can affect it (like ``discount`` or ``subtotal_discount``) in the JSON at the same time, then ``total`` will always take priority. You can specify ``total``, but not ``subtotal`` in the JSON. 

---------------
Response Format
---------------

* The order has been updated successfully: **HTTP/1.1 200 OK** and the order ID::

    {
     "order_id": "98"
    }

* The order couldn’t be updated: **HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request**.

* The order doesn’t exist: **HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found**.

===============
Delete an Order
===============

To delete an order, send the DELETE request to ``/api/orders/<order_id>/``. For example::

  DELETE /api/orders/98/

This request will delete an order with ``order_id=98``.

---------------
Response Format
---------------

* The order has been deleted successfully: **HTTP/1.1 204 No Content**.

* The order couldn’t be deleted: **HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request**.
 
* The order doesn’t exist: **HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found**.
