************************
Product Variation Groups
************************

Let's say we have a T-shirt available in 3 colors and 5 sizes in your store. It means we have 15 similar products. We want to switch between the colors and sizes on the storefront.

To do this, we have to put these similar products in a variation group. In this case the product will be considered as a :doc:`variation </user_guide/manage_products/products/product_variations>`. A product can belong only to one group at the same time, but it’s easy to change the product’s group. If a variation is removed from the group, it becomes a standard product.

* http://example.com/api/**product_variations_groups** —refer to all product variation groups. 

  Only ``GET`` and ``POST`` are supported.


* http://example.com/api/**product_variations_groups/:id** —refer to a product variation group. 

  ``GET``, ``PUT``, and ``DELETE`` are supported.
  
  .. important::
  
      ``DELETE`` deletes only a variation group, i.e. disbands it. The variations from this group are not deleted. They become regular products. 

 
* http://example.com/api/**product_variations_groups/:code** —refer to a product variation group. 

  ``GET``, ``PUT``, and ``DELETE`` are supported.

    *   -   Parameter 
        -   Desription
    *   -   ``product_ids``
        -   Filtering by product IDs. If the parameter is specified, the response will contain those variation groups that contain at least one of the listed products.
    *   -   ``feature_ids``
        -   Filtering by features. If the parameter is specified, the response will contain those variation groups that contain at least one of the listed features.
 
        
Fields
======

* ``id``—variation group ID;

* ``code``—variation group code;

* ``features``—list of the product features that were used to create the product variation group;

    * ``feature_id``—product feature ID;

    * ``variant_id``—ID of the product feature variant;

* ``created_at``—time when the variation group was created;

* ``updated_at``—last time when the variation group was updated.
