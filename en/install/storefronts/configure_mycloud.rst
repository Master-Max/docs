How To: Configure Multiple Storefronts at Cloud Hosting
*******************************************************

MyCloud interface includes the possibility to add sites or redirects to your server's configuration.

To add an alias or a redirect, go to the **Sites** (1) section in your MyCloud account, check the **www** (2) checkbox if you need to add the www.subdomain, type the domain of an alias or a redirect in the **Domain** (3) field and select the **Type** (4) of the site you need to add.

There are two types of sites you can add via MyCloud â€” aliases and redirects:

* An **alias** domain is an alternate name for another existing domain. When we talk about marketplace platforms, alias usually means an additional storefront to your project.

* A **redirect** changes the site's URL to the required one and moves visitors to the site where the content is actually located.

Let's add an alias to the server configuration and see how it works (the process is the same for a redirect). When you select the type you need from the list, the **Destination** (5) field where you need to choose a project to which the alias will be added from the list will arise. When the **Destination** project is selected, click **Add new site** (6). Done, the **example.com** alias is added to the server configuration.
