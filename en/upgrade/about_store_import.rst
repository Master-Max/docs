About Store Import
******************

**Store Import** is an add-on that imports the database from an older version of your store to the new one. The process takes several steps: 

1. Install the new CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor to a subfolder of your old store.

2. Import the data from your old store to the new one with :doc:`the Store Import add-on <../user_guide/addons/store_import/index>`.

3. Configure your new store (CSS styles, layouts, blocks, settings, etc.). In the meantime, your old store can continue working as usual.

4. Import the data that was accumulated in your old store while you were customizing your new store.

==================
Supported Versions
==================

The table below shows what versions of CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor you can import data from (the *Upgrade from* column), and what versions come with the **Store Import** add-on (the *Upgrade to* column):

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 5 5

    *   -   Upgrade from:
        -   Upgrade to:
    *   -   CS-Cart Professional 2.2.4 - 3.0.6
        -   CS-Cart 4.0.2 - 4.7.2
    *   -   CS-Cart Ultimate 3.0.1 - 3.0.6
        -   CS-Cart 4.0.2 - 4.7.2
    *   -   CS-Cart Multi-Vendor 2.2.4 - 3.0.6
        -   Multi-Vendor 4.0.2 - 4.7.2

.. important::

    The **Store Import** add-on is not available in all versions of CS-Cart. If you don't have it, and want to import data to newer versions of CS-Cart, please `get the free Store Import add-on from the CS-Cart Marketplace <https://marketplace.cs-cart.com/store-import.html>`_.

.. note::

    Technically, **Store Import** can be used to do jump between patch and minor versions (for example, from 4.3.1 to 4.3.9, and from 4.4.1 to 4.6.2 respectively). However, we recommend using :doc:`the Upgrade Center <upgrade_process>` if you'd like to upgrade your store from CS-Cart or Multi-Vendor 4.0.x and later versions.

============
Restrictions
============

----------------------
Technical Restrictions
----------------------

* Store Import can't import several CS-Cart Professional stores to one CS-Cart installation as different storefronts.
    
* CS-Cart Community stores cannot be imported directly.

.. important::

    CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor 4.2.x and 4.3.x require **PHP 5.3.x** or higher. CS-Cart 4.3.6 requires **PHP 5.3.6** or higher.

--------------------
License Restrictions
--------------------

You can use the **Store Import** add-on if you own a license with an active upgrade subscription. If you license does not have an active upgrade subscription, you can either prolong upgrades for the current license, or buy a new license.

.. important::

    Don't use both the old and the new store at the same time with one license. Keep the new store closed (**Settings → General → Close storefront**) while you configure it. Close the storefront of the old store right after you go live with your new store. :doc:`Learn more about closing your storefront <../user_guide/look_and_feel/changing_attributes/store_closed>`.

=============
Imported Data
=============

Depending on what version of CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor you used for your old store, some data may be left out during the import process.

----------
From 3.0.x
----------

The add-on imports all the data, including layouts and settings.

----------------
From 2.2.4/2.2.5
----------------

The add-on **doesn't** import some settings:

* Core settings (the **Settings** section of the Administration panel) are replaced with default settings.

* Add-on settings are imported.


The add-on **doesn't** import most of the layout data (information about blocks and tabs). There are some **exceptions**:

* Blocks from **Design → Layouts → Products** are imported if they have the *Products* type and their **Filling** is set to *Manually*.

* The **Description**, **Features** and **Files** product tabs are imported by default.

* The product tabs created automatically after the installation of certain add-ons are also imported.
