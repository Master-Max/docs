Call Requests
*************

This add-on adds a **Buy now with 1-click** button on a product details page in the storefront. When a customer clicks the button, a popup window with a short contact form appears. As a store admin, you will see the list of call requests in the `Orders → Call requests <http://docs.cs-cart.com/latest/user_guide/orders/call_requests/index.html>`_ section of the administration panel with detailed information about each request.

Also, you can add the **Call requests** block to the storefront in the **Design → Layouts** section. When clicking the **Request call** link on the storefront, customers will also see a form where they can type their name, phone, and a period of time convenient for a call.

Products added to a customer's cart will be mentioned in the created call request in the **Orders → Call requests** section.
