PayPal Commerce Platform
************************

By default, :doc:`all the money from orders in Multi-Vendor goes to marketplace owner </user_guide/users/vendors/workflow>`. After that, vendors can request that money when they decide to withdraw it. The marketplace owner then has to transfer that money to vendors by whatever means.

The PayPal Commerce Platform add-on allows marketplace owners to make the splitting process automatic. Money from each order is automatically distributed between the marketplace and the involved vendors.

How to Install and Configure the Add-on
=======================================

#. Install the PayPal Commerce Platform add-on :doc:`just like any other add-on </user_guide/addons/1manage_addons>`.

#. Create  a payment method that uses PayPal Commerce Platfrorm.

#. Have your vendors connect their PayPal accounts to your marketplace.That will allow them to receive money from orders.
