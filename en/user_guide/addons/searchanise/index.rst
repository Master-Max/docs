The **Searchanise** add-on integrates CS-Cart with the SaaS-solution of the same name. It adds enhanced instant product search to the storefront by replacing its regular search bar with a special search widget. Shoppers see search results as they type in the search bar, and can quickly review the found products. So, customers can get to the right product way much faster because they donâ€™t even have to finish typing while the preview box forms the first impression of the product.

=============
Functionality
=============

`Searchanise <https://docs.searchanise.io/how-searchanise-works-cs-cart/>`_ can search through products, categories and pages (i.e., blog posts) in your store. Search by products is carried out by their code, name, description, features, and option combination codes. 

.. note ::

    Starting with version 4.8.1, Searchanise is compatible with the :doc:`/user_guide/addons/age_verification/index` add-on. Products restricted by age will only be displayed in search results if a customer has verified his or her age.
