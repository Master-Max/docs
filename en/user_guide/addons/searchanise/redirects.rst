Here is how you can do it:

1.   On the **Redirects** tab, click the green **+** button.
2.   Type "tablet, tablet pc, ipad" in the **Search Terms, Comma-separated** column.
3.   Type your promo page URL in the **Redirect To** column, e.g.: *tablet-sale* (you can use both absolute and relative paths).
4.   Click the **Save Items** button.

To search for a particular search redirects, type it in the **Search redirects** field and click the **Filter** button.

To delete a suggestion:

1.   Choose the checkboxes of the desired redirects in the **Delete** row and click the **Delete selected** button.
