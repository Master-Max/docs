Stop words are special words that are disregarded during search (learn more on `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words>`_).

By default, such words as *a*, *the*, and some prepositions are added to the stop word list. In this tab, you can add your own stop words.

To add a new stop word:

1.  On the **Stop words** tab, click the green **+** button
2.  Type the term in the **Stop word** column.
3.  Click the **Save items** button.

.. note ::

    Note that the new stop word will become available in the storefront only after the indexation is complete.

To delete a stop word:

1.  Choose the checkboxes of the desired words in the **Delete** row and click the **Delete selected** button.
2.  In the opened window click **OK** to confirm the action.
