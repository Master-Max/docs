A search term synonym is another search term, which, when searched, is treated like the search term itself.

For example, declare a synonym for the word *ipad* to be *tablet*. When the word *tablet* is searched in the storefront, the search results will be the same as if the word *ipad* was searched. In both cases, the result for *ipad* will be returned.

.. note ::

    Note that this will work differently in reverse: if you set *ipad* to be a synonym for *tablet*, then both searches will return the result for *tablet*.

Here is how you can define a synonym for the search term *ipad*:

1.  On the **Synonyms** tab, click the green **+** button.
2.  Check **Add to the suggestion list** if you want to guarantee that this search term is suggested.
3.  In the **Synonyms, comma-separated** column, type *tablet*.
4.  Click the **Save items** button.

.. important ::

    The new synonym will become available in the storefront only after the indexation is complete.

To search for a particular search synonyms, type it in the **Search synonyms** field and click the **Filter** button.

To **delete** a synonym:

1.  Choose the checkboxes of the desired synonyms in the **Delete** row and click the **Delete selected** button.
2.  In the opened window click **OK** to confirm the action.
