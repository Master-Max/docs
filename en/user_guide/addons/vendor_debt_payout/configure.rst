************************************************* 
How To: Configure Vendor-to-Admin Payments Add-on
*************************************************

.. important::

    This add-on replaced the Vendor Debt Payout add-on in Multi-Vendor 4.12.1.

Install the Vendor-to-Admin Payments add-on :doc:`just like any other add-on </user_guide/addons/1manage_addons>`. After the installation, click on the add-on name to open its settings. Here you can do the following:

* Decide when a vendor becomes a debtor. By default, these rules are global and apply to all your vendors. However, you can allow own values of these settings for different vendor plans.

  .. note::

      To allow different values for different vendor plans, click the button next to the settings.

* Choose taxes to be included to vendor payments. Here you can see :doc:`all the taxes </user_guide/shipping_and_taxes/taxes/index>` created on the **Administration → Shipping & taxes → Taxes** page.

  .. note::

      The setting first appeared in Multi-Vendor 4.14.1.

* Decide what restrictions to apply to suspended vendors: hide their products and/or block their admin panels.

* Decide whether to completely disable accounts of those vendors who don't pay their debts for a long time (and when to disable them).

* See what notifications the add-on has, and edit them.
