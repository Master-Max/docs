.. note::

    This article applies only to **Multi-Vendor**.


The **Vendor Plans** add-on allows you to offer subscription plans for vendors. These plans can have restrictions in number of products, revenue, allowed categories, and so on. Depending on how you configure the add-on, vendors may or may not be able to switch to other plans themselves.
