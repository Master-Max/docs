   * **Stripe account country**—select the country of your Stripe account.

   * **Currency**—the currency of your Stripe account.

   * **Payment type**—what type of payments this method will accept:

#. For Apple Pay or Google Pay, you'll need to add the correct icon to the payment method. You'll find the correct icon for each of the payment methods on the **Configure** tab. Both Apple and Google require that their icons are displayed at least as prominently as the other payment method icons in your store.

#. Choose whether or not to show the instant purchase button on the product page.

#. Click **Create** to finish the creation of the payment method. Now it should be available to customers. Please note that:

   * Apple Pay button will appear only in Safari on Apple devices.

   * Google Pay button will appear only to Google Chrome, if a credit card is linked to the Google account.
