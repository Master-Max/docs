.. important::

    Vendors are available only in Multi-Vendor.

Use this section to adjust vendor settings for the administration panel and the storefront.

* **Display product vendor**—if you enable this setting, the name of the product vendor will appear next to the product description.

* **Allow vendors to edit layouts** (only in Multi-Vendor Plus)—if you enable this setting, vendors will be able to edit specific :doc:`layout pages </user_guide/look_and_feel/layouts/layout_pages/index>`.

* **Allow vendors to manage styles of the theme** (only in Multi-Vendor Plus)—if you enable this setting, vendors will be able to use :doc:`the Theme Editor </user_guide/look_and_feel/themes/theme_editor>`.

  .. note::

      For more information on how vendors work with layouts and styles, please refer to :doc:`this article </user_guide/users/vendors/allow_vendors_to_edit_layout_and_theme>`.

* **Allow users to apply for vendor account**—if you enable this setting, customers will be able to send the root administrator a request to become a vendor.

  .. hint::

      Here's how to :doc:`configure the vendor application form and lead customers to it</user_guide/users/vendors/allow_customers_to_apply_for_vendor_account>`.

* **Vendors per page**—the number of vendors displayed on one page.

* **Allow vendors to manage product features**—if you enable this setting, vendors will be able add new :doc:`product features </user_guide/manage_products/features/index>` and edit them.

* **Review new vendors before granting access to the admin panel**—if you enable this setting, administrator will have to check every new vendor and approve/disapprove their accounts. Before checking, all new vendors will have the :doc:`New status </user_guide/users/vendors/vendor_statuses>`, so they will have access neither to the storefront nor to their vendor panel.
