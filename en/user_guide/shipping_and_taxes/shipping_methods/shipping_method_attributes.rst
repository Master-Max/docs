All shipping methods can be split into 2 groups, depending on how the rates are calculated:

* :doc:`Manual methods (by rate areas) </user_guide/shipping_and_taxes/shipping_methods/manual_shipping_methods/index>` calculate rates based on the rules you specify manually in the Administration panel.

* :doc:`Real-time shipping methods (automatic) </user_guide/shipping_and_taxes/shipping_methods/realtime_shipping_methods/index>` send the relevant order data to third-party services when a customer proceeds to checkout. If the service ships to the specified destination, the shipping method will be available to the customer.

* **Status**—the status of the shipping method: **Active** or **Disabled**.

* **Weight limit**—the minimum and maximum weight of the order that can be delivered via this method. If an order doesn’t meet the weight requirements, then this shipping method won’t be offered to the customer.

* **User groups**—the user groups, the members of which will be able choose this shipping method at checkout.

* **Shipping service**—shipping services provided by the carrier. Carrier—the online service or a carrier API that will be used for rate calculation. The **Shipping service** setting is available only if **Rate calculation** is set to any variant of *Real-time (automatic)*.

=========
Configure
=========

This tab appears only if you have set **Rate calculation** to any variant of *Real-time (automatic)* on the **General** tab. It means that the rates will be requested from a third-party service depending on the order data when a customer proceeds to checkout. 

Here you should specify the settings of the selected shipping service. Such settings vary depending on the shipping service provider. So, if you do not know how to configure it, please refer to the carrier’s help pages and :doc:`our documentation </user_guide/shipping_and_taxes/shipping_methods/realtime_shipping_methods/index>`.

.. hint::

    Once you have configured the settings, click **Save**. Then you’ll be able to go back to the **General** tab and test the rate calculation as described above.

=======================
Shipping time and rates
=======================

You need to decide where your shipping method will be offered. To do this, choose the rate areas from the dropdown list. If there is a rate area in the store which you did not include in the shipping method, orders will not be delivered in this area.

.. important::

    If a certain rate area does not exist in your store, you can :doc:`add it  </user_guide/shipping_and_taxes/locations/set_location>`. This is only necessary if you need to add different conditions and availability/unavailability of delivery to this area.

If you receive rates from a shipping service provider in real time, the charges from this section will be simply added to the received rates. You can use this to compensate for your actual expenses if they exceed the values returned by the carrier (e.g., packing, insurance, etc.)

You can specify price, weight or items conditions for each rate area. Once you’re done specifying them, click **Save**.

* **From**—the minimum value starting from which the specified surcharge/discount is applied.

* **To**—the maximum value up to which the specified surcharge/discount is applied.

* **Surcharge / discount** — the amount of money that will be added to the base **Rate** or reduced from it. To make a discount just add the “-” (minus) sign to the entered value.

.. important::

    If you do not specify the **Rate** value or any price/weight/items conditions for the :doc:`rate areas </user_guide/shipping_and_taxes/locations/index>` you have added, delivery to those rate areas will be free. 

=====================
Test rate calculation
=====================

Click the **Recalculate rates** button to find out the shipping cost. The calculation considers the weight that you specify in the form, as well as the :doc:`company address and default customer address </user_guide/shipping_and_taxes/address>`.

Additional settings
===================

* **Icon**—an image to represent the shipping method.

  You can upload an icon from your computer, find it on the server, or provide a URL to the image.  Make sure to enter the alternative text that’ll appear when the icon is missing or can’t be displayed. Specifying alternative texts is good for `SEO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization>`_.

  Images must be of one of the following formats only: JPEG, GIF, PNG. The maximum size of an uploaded image depends on your server configuration.  As a rule, it should not exceed 2 MB.

  .. note::

      Shipping method icons appear on the storefront in a special **Shipping methods** block. You can create this block on the **Design → Layouts page**.
	  
* **Taxes**—the tax rates that apply to the shipping method.

* **Customer must specify his/her address**—tick the box if you want customers to specify their addresses.

* **Use for free shipping**—tick the box so that the products with the **Free shipping** option enabled are not included in the calculation
