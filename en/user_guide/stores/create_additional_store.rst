How To: Create an Additional Store
**********************************

A storefront creation in CS-Cart produces another independent store. It is useful when you need an additional store, market-friendly for a certain country or region. A new store is also necessary, for example, if you want to expand into new markets.

To create an additional store:

#. :doc:`Add a new storefront <create_new_store>` in the admin panel.

#. :doc:`Set up the storefront on the server </install/storefronts/index>`. Now you can :doc:`switch between storefronts and operation modes <switch_between_stores>`.

#. If the new storefront is for the market of another country, then set up :doc:`redirect to a storefront localized for the country <global_entry_point>` of the new customers.

#. Fill the created storefront with:

   * Goods. Create new product cards or :doc:`use existing ones <sharing>` by assigning new categories to the product.

     In CS-Cart, categories determine the storefronts to which products belong. That's why you cannot use old categories for a new storeâ€”create the new ones. :doc:`One product can be shared among several storefronts <many_stores_one_catalog>`, nevertheless different properties are assigned to the product on different storefronts.

   * Payment and shipping methods. Create new methods or use existing ones by changing the settings on the *Storefronts* tab of the payment or shipping method.

#. Set :doc:`other settings <store_settings>` for language, currency, design, storefront display, customer actions, etc.
